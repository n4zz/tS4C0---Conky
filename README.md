Two versions of Conky.       
1. Desktop - (as is my custom) contains the following information:
   * CPU
   * GPU
   * RAM
   * Network
   * Storage
   * Top 5 processes
   * Calendar
   * Weather
2. Laptop -
   * CPU
   * RAM
   * Battery
   * Network
   * Storage
   * Top 5 processes
   * Calendar
   * Weather      
   (I don't use GPU information in the laptop version because my laptop doesn't have a dedicated graphics card).

### How to run Conky.       
(I use conky.conf configuration files, which are called by a bash script.)      
1. Download the files       
2. Put the files in your conky directory       
3. Run the conky-startup.sh script in the terminal       
Done.      
(I use the /home/.config/conky/ directory for conky.      
If you use a different directory, you will need to edit both the script and the conky.conf files).
